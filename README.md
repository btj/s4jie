Specs (= method pre- and postconditions) for Java in Eclipse

The goal of this project is to hack Eclipse's Java development tooling so that it supports editing and building programs that specify preconditions and postconditions for methods as boolean Java expressions inside comments, like so:
```java
class Account {

    private int balance;
    
    public int getBalance() { return balance; }
    
    public Account()
        //@ post getBalance() == 0;
    {}
    
    public void deposit(int amount)
        //@ pre 0 <= amount;
        //@ post getBalance() == old(getBalance()) + amount;
    {
        balance += amount;
    }
    
    public void withdraw(int amount)
        //@ pre 0 <= amount && amount <= getBalance();
        //@ post getBalance() == old(getBalance()) - amount;
    {
        balance -= amount;
    }

}
```
Edit-time support should include syntax highlighting, squigglies indicating malformed or ill-typed fragments, code completion, and refactoring. Build-time support should include optionally generating run-time checks. The hacked Eclipse should be suitable for use by students as part of their Java programming course.

It should be as easy as possible to keep the hacked Eclipse up-to-date with the upstream Eclipse, so as to incorporate work done upstream to support new Java language features, add new editor features, fix bugs, etc.

The Parser
==========

The JDT Java parser is in class [`org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.parser.Parser`](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.core/blob/master/org.eclipse.jdt.core/compiler/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/compiler/parser/Parser.java). It is an LR parser; the LR tables are generated from the grammar file [`java.g`](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.core/blob/master/org.eclipse.jdt.core/grammar/java.g) using the JikesPG parser generator. The process is described in document [How to: Generate the Parser](http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/howto/generate%20parser/generateParser.html). A number of manual steps are required to transform the files generated by JikesPG.

JikesPG was originally developed as the parser generator for the IBM Jikes Java compiler. It was eventually released on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jikes/files/Jikes%20Parser%20Generator/) by Chris Abbey and Dave Shields. This is where the "How to" document points. However, recently Dave Shields created a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/daveshields/jikespg) for JikesPG. I [forked](https://github.com/btj/jikespg) it.
